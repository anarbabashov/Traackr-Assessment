# Senior UX Exercise

This exercise is meant to give you a chance to showcase your UX skills, as well as give you a glimpse into the life of a UX engineer at Traackr. You'll be given a Figma mockup, some data, and you'll be creating a usable UI for users to play with.

It should be about 4 hours of work. We understand everyone has different circumstances in life, so you have about a week to deliver a final product once you receive the instructions.

## Context

As an influencer marketing software company, a key component of the industry, and our business, is working with content creators. A common feature is for marketers to search through a list of influencers to find individuals they would like to work with.

You will be building a UI that is a list of influencers and includes common information about each person, as well as some metrics about them. The UI will include some basic features such as the ability to search by keyword, and paginate.

## Assignment

Here are the details for the assignment. If you have any questions, please feel free reach out!

* Translate the Figma mockup into HTML and CSS. Design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/3KQaU8CnoUQDZ5oRJgFy0S/UX-Engineer-Test?node-id=0%3A1).
* Build a UI that's accessible and usable for different audiences and users, including mobile users.
* Consumes the provided JSON file that has your data and renders the list of influencers.
* Users can search by keyword (name, description) to filter the list
* The list is paginated, with 10 people per page
* You can use whatever FE framework you are most comfortable with. We use [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) at Traackr, but feel free to use the tool of your choice
* You can use a CSS library if you want to (e.g. Bulma, Bootstrap, Tailwind)
* Tests should be written for the code created
* You can assume you only need to support modern browsers and modern JS

## Deliverables

* The final product should be deployed somewhere that we can access without building it locally ([Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a free platform, but there are others available too)
* The code should be delivered in a ZIP/RAR package and emailed back to us, along with the URL when you're done (You can leave out any modules like `node_modules`)

## What We're Looking For

Traackr culture is big on transparency, support, and giving the tools to help everyone succeed. As such, here are the elements that we are looking for when we will evaluate the final product that you deliver.

* How close the final product is to the mockup.
* How the components are designed and the overall architecture of components.
* How the code is structured and good code practices.
* What tests are written and the quality of tests written.

## Expectations From Traackr

You can expect a response from us soon after you deliver your final product!
